# BlinkBasedController
A device that uses Neurosky Mindwave 2 headset to detect eye blinks and uses it to control a buggy. 
The code is based on mbed FRDM K64F microcontroller, and it includes a library to interface with Neurosky Mindwave by decoding data sent by ThinkGear chip. 
The library was influences by the Arduino code developed by [S. Kravitz, "Hackers in Residence - Hacking MindWave Mobile learn.sparkfun.com", Learn.sparkfun.com, 2013. [Online]. Available:

All required files to implement the project are included.
